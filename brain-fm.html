                Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic

                <br>
                <br>
                We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using
                <br>
                fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests,
                <br>
                measuring performance on simple games.
                <br>

                Our experiments always include a control condition
