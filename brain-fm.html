                function music, including technology to elicit stong neural 
                phrase locking-allowing poulations of neurons to engage in 
                various kinds of coordinated activity - and technology to 
                remove ditraction in sound.

                <br>
                This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a
                desired mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to
                create music that helps you do wwhat you need to

            <p>
                Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic
                institutions to run experiments.
                <br>
                <br>
                We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using
                fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests,
                measuring performance on simple games.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our experiments always include a control condition
                ('placebo) of the same underlying music without Brain.fm
                technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes
                the difference.
